        <p>This website is a part of a student project for the Server Side Web Development module at MTU.</p>

        <p>The application allows users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Register new equipment and assign it to a specific room</li>
            <li>Update or delete equipment records</li>
            <li>Search for equipment by name, type, or room</li>
            <li>View all equipment data stored in a MongoDB database</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The system was developed using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express.js</strong> for backend server logic</li>
            <li><strong>MongoDB</strong> for database storage</li>
            <li><strong>EJS</strong> for dynamic rendering of web pages</li>
            <li>Custom <strong>CSS</strong> for responsive styling</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This platform helps manage equipment registrations efficiently and serves as a foundation for understanding CRUD operations, routing, database integration, and responsive design.</p>
